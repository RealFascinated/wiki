# Anticheat Support

<NavBanner href="/wiki/cachyos/gaming/about" text="Return to Gaming Guide" />

Most first-person shooters have some form of anticheat. Some anticheats such as EasyAntiCheat (EAC) **are** supported by Linux, but they usually don't have this support enabled.

Games such as **Valorant**, **Apex Legends** and **Fortnite** are NOT supported by Linux currently, for the full list of supported games, check [AreWeAntiCheatYet](https://areweanticheatyet.com/).
